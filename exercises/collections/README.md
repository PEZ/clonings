# Collections

One of the core tenets of Clojure is ["polymorphism"](https://clojure.org/about/rationale#_object_orientation_is_overrated). One example of this principle is that many functions in the core library operate on a common set of abstractions (interfaces).

Here are some of the primary collections in Clojure:

- seq
- list
- map
- vector
- set
